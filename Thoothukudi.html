The ancient town of Korkai has been a centre for maritime trade and pearl fishery for more than 2000 years. Since 1997, as is the case in other districts of Tamil Nadu, this district has been named after its headquarters town, Thoothukuda.The major harbour of Thoothukudi is one of the oldest seaports in the world and was the seaport of the Pandyan kingdom after Korkai, near Palayakayal. It was later taken over by the Portuguese in 1548, captured by the Dutch in 1658, and ceded to the British in 1825. The lighthouse built in 1842 marked the beginning of the history of harbour development in the city.</p>
