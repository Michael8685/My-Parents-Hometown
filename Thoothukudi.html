              fishing and shipbuilding industries. The ancient town of Korkai has been a centre for maritime trade and
              pearl fishery for more than 2000 years. Since 1997, as is the case in other districts of Tamil Nadu, this
              district has been named after its headquarters town, Thoothukuda.The major harbour of Thoothukudi is one
              of the oldest seaports in the world and was the seaport of the Pandyan kingdom after Korkai, near
              Palayakayal. It was later taken over by the Portuguese in 1548, captured by the Dutch in 1658, and ceded
              to the British in 1825. The lighthouse built in 1842 marked the beginning of the history of harbour
              development in the city.</p>
